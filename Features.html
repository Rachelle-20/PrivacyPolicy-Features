            <p class="text-sm md:text-base">
                <br>DeskSync incorporates a robust user authentication and verification process. Upon registration, users are required to verify their email address, and each new account undergoes an admin approval process before full access is granted. This ensures a controlled onboarding experience.
                <br><br>Furthermore, our system employs Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), distinguishing between regular users and administrators. This means that once logged in, users are directed to a tailored interface based on their assigned role. Regular users enjoy a user-friendly interface for booking hotdesks, while administrators have a dedicated interface with additional controls and functionalities to manage approvals, monitor usage, and optimize the system for the best overall experience.
